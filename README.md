### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

My name is Hung Nguyen, I am currently a student studying in University of Massachusetts - Amherst, major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Over the last few years, I have been working as an intern or as a collaborator on multiple fields that I am interested in, dabbling in new technologies in AI, web, and software in general. Coding is something that I really love doing, besides chess, League of Legends, and reading as my hobbies. I hope I can use my skill to do things that are impactful to the society, and help build a better future.

## Some languages I used
